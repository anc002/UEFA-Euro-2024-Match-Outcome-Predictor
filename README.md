# UEFA Euro 2024 Match Outcome Predictor

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict the outcomes of UEFA Euro 2024 matches using historical match data, FIFA rankings, and various performance metrics of the teams. The aim is to provide insights for strategic planning, betting, and fan engagement by forecasting match results before they occur.


## Features
- Predictive Modeling: Utilizes SVM, Random Forest, and KNN algorithms to model and predict match outcomes including home wins, away wins, and draws.
- Feature Engineering: Dynamic calculation of match-specific metrics such as team form, head-to-head statistics, and recent FIFA points changes.
- Probability Estimates: Enhances decision-making by providing probability estimates for potential match outcomes, particularly useful during knockout stages.
- Visualization: Utilizes matplotlib and seaborn for comprehensive exploratory data analysis, enabling the identification of patterns, trends, and anomalies that inform subsequent modeling strategies.
- Parameter Optimization: Employs GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy and performance.

## Data Sources:
The UEFA Euro 2024 Match Outcome Predictor leverages datasets hosted on Kaggle, which is known for its comprehensive collection of data science and machine learning resources. These datasets provide a solid foundation for training our predictive models with accurate and historically significant data.

- FIFA Rankings: This dataset includes FIFA's official world rankings of national football teams, updated monthly. These rankings are essential for evaluating the relative strengths of teams over time and play a crucial role in our feature engineering process. Available on Kaggle: FIFA World Rankings Dataset.
- International Football Results: This dataset encompasses international football match results from 1872 to 2024, offering comprehensive details such as match dates, teams, scores, and tournament types. It is vital for generating features like head-to-head statistics and recent team performance metrics. Available on Kaggle: International Football Results from 1872 to 2024.

These datasets are integrated and processed to derive features that influence match outcomes, such as team rankings, recent performance metrics, and historical match data. By utilizing this comprehensive data, the project aims to provide accurate and insightful predictions for upcoming UEFA Euro 2024 matches.
